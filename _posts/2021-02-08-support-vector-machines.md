What are support vector machines. This kind of architecture let's us make decision boundaries for classification purposes, which uses Lagrangian multipliers and the wolfe duality principles, to find the multipliers that let's us find the min of the error based on the multiple hyperplanes... out of which the best one is the one with the farthest distance.
